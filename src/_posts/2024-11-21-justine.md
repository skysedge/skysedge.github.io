title: Second personal update from Justine

If you haven't seen my previous update, reading it will provide context for this public post I put on Facebook:


<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fjustine.hauptlabate%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0drhw1KvgchvnPUNspKfDuucrz4ux1YjUB1Xa27US7NDtMWzTSpZMEH3FaBDYpGNGl&show_text=true&width=500" width="500" height="538" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>

This part is actually a copy-paste from my the previous update, but it's equally relevant and I don't think people really saw that update:

My dream of making Sky's Edge successful and using it to make a positive impact on the technological world has not changed, and in some ways the experience with my husband has sharpened my perspective of what this should mean. I'm grateful to my colleagues -- my friends -- that are helping with ongoing manufacturing and development and generally stepping in as I have not been able, all for the hope that this will eventually pay off in all the ways we want it to. I'm also grateful for financial contributions that have allowed us to continue operating, and for those customers who've give us more grace than we would seem to deserve.

For ongoing updates I'm going to try to lean on the other Sky's Edge team members to keep the community filled in.
