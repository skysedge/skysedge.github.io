Hello customers, former customers, and friends,

Every now and then I see some speculation that I might be dealing with a health issue, or some other noteworthy event that has made my attentiveness to the rotary unsmartphone project less than what it ought to be. This is close to the truth and the time has come that I need to be more open about it.

My husband, the love of my life, was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer almost three years ago. In the intervening time he's undergone numerous courses of treatment with multiple doctors. More recently, the disease has progressed.

Close friends know that I'm somewhat of an open book, and I moderate myself now in writing this out of respect for my husband's and family's privacy. What I will say is that being with him through this process, watching him deteriorate, has taken all of my energy, and such a thing changes a person.

As of today, I've been living with him in the local ICU since August 11th. I don't think I ever really belivied it would get to this point. Unprecedented breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy are happening all the time now and I've always told myself we'd be able to beat it.

My dream of making Sky's Edge successful and using it to make a positive impact on the technological world has not changed, and in some ways the experience with my husband has sharpened my perspective of what this should mean. I'm grateful to my colleagues -- my friends -- that are helping with ongoing manufacturing and development and generally stepping in as I have not been able, all for the hope that this will eventually pay off in all the ways we want it to. I'm also grateful for financial contributions that have allowed us to continue operating, and for those customers who've give us more grace than we would seem to deserve.

For ongoing updates I'm going to try to lean on the other Sky's Edge team members to keep the community filled in.

~Justine
