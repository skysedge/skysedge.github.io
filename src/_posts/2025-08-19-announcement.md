title: Incoming Batch and RUSP Project Update
author: Justine Haupt
---


A number of months ago we decided the build is really just *too* tricky for the vast majority of first-time builders, so we started pre-assembling the difficult mechanical bits. Namely, the core of the dialing mechanism, which involved winding the main "clockspring", as well as the governor, can be rage-inducing. 

Our amazing volunteer team has been working on building these, and these will be sent out with the rest of the kit once the boards arrive. The batch of 300 RUSP Motherboards we're currently awaiting from China (pcbway.com) is expected now on August 31st, so many people will finally be getting their phones in September. We thought it would be August, but the customs situation for parts we sent going into China delayed things by at least two weeks, so it’s September.

After this we’ll be contracting 1-2 more batches to fill all the previous RUSP orders that are still unfilled. 

As always, please please please email info@skysedge.com to ask for a refund if you're done waiting. If I were you, I would be fed up too.

And then, I'm honestly relieved to announce... it's done. We're officially canceling RUSP after the current orders are satisfied. 

My conclusion is that this just isn't a game for the ragtag team that we are. There are too many figurative and literal parts, the regulatory constraints change too frequently, and most of all manufacturing is so very HARD. It's no wonder there are only a small handful of players in the cellphone market and that by and large they tend to be mega-corporations. 

It’s also clear that I also set the sale price too low because even after all of this, we’ve lost money and it’s only by the grace of angel investment that we’re able to finally ship them.


I'm personally burnt out and have been since I lost my husband. Our team is also burnt out.

We all acknowledge that it's a cool thing, a fun thing, potentially a very useful thing for some, but I have to call it. As said above we're committed to filling the existing orders, and will provide builder support for those customers, but then I that's going to be the end of it. 

We’re so incredibly thankful to all the customers that have held out for so long; longer than we might have in their position. I’m personally thankful for their seemingly unlimited encouragement and understanding. I’m thankful for the life lessons.
