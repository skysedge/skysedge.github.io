Kits are going out again!

Motherboards are in stock, our new programming and test fixture is working, we've pre-assembled the complicated parts and rewrote the instructions, and as of today, the first 5 kits out of the current batch of 300 are in the mail. The remaining 300 will be in everyone's hands in the next month. As always, please contact us at info@skysedge.com with questions.
