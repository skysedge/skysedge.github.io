title: Outsourcing Production

Apparently, I’ve been an absolute fool to believe we could ever successfully manufacture the RUSP in house in Riverhead, NY. Our quality-control “pass” rate has been like 20%, although we can get that up to about 60% after manual re-soldering. It’s just not a tenable way to fill orders. Anyone reading this will surely say “newsflash” in sarcastic tone, but I now realize that manufacturing was not something I ought to have taken on so lightly.

Also, I’ve been trying desperately not to appear to use this as an excuse, but I have to admit that my husband’s cancer diagnosis and subsequent death obviously had a significant impact on my ability to manage the company, do engineering, and actually try filling  orders. I don’t want to dwell on that topic any more than to say that my mental health is doing much much better for the past couple months and my productivity and energy are quite good again.

SO, the new plan (for the past few months now, really), is that we simply need to outsource manufacturing. There’s a business team now, thank God, and we’re engaged with two separate PCB assembly facilities abroad, one of which will fill the current backlog of orders. I know everyone will want to know “when”. My track record for this response has been so abysmal that I will decline to predict here, but knowing that an actual manufacturing company will be doing all work from here on out should, I think, give anyone reading this slight reassurance that it’s still going to happen.

We’re also working on getting proper investor support for a “box-built” (ready to use) product with a hard re-release in the future. Some new requirements exist now, though. For example, bluetooth compatibility for the hearing-impaired is now a requirement for handsets sold in the US. So, this also becomes the natural time to fix some engineering/manufacturability and durability issues to make it a more robust “daily driver” phone as well, also while having a less daunting assembly process, which will be needed for assembly line manufacturing in any case.

Lastly, anyone who’s been emailing info@skysedge.com lately had been getting a response from my cousin Jackie. She’s been doing great but she just took an internship out of state that she couldn’t refuse, so I wish her well while looking for someone local (eastern Long Island) to come help us at the office with customer service and with helping write updates, etc. I say this in case anyone knows anyone who might be a good fit. Actually, anyone local who has skills of any kind to offer (electrical engineering, software development, and business-types are still in demand) should reach out.

As always, we do our best to process refund requests as they come in.
