      <em>"There will be stars over the place forever;
      Though the house we loved and the street we loved are lost, Every
      time the earth circles her orbit On the night the autumn equinox is
      crossed, Two stars we knew, poised on the peak of midnight Will
      reach their zenith; stillness will be deep; There will be stars over
      the place forever, There will be stars forever, while we sleep."
      &nbsp &nbspâ€” Sara Teasdale</em>
