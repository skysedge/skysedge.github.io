      <![CDATA[<p>MakerGear® announced today a new generation of desktop 3D printers geared toward industry and education. The<span> </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YmgkV5I-g0LhpA5rPnrr8QeqUUP84AGGPq6sxYNSjs5IogpsHDmkEp4r7J8wlkcJpB-E_COod148h2DI_vuw9g==" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="MakerGear M3">MakerGear M3</a><span> </span>and<strong><span> </span>M3 Independent Dual</strong><span> </span>debut at the RAPID + TCT 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing show in Pittsburgh, PA May 8-11, 2017.  </p>
<p>This new generation of MakerGear 3D printers offers advancements that build on MakerGear’s precision machined systems and designs that emphasize performance and enable continuous, 24/7 operation. With features that make it easier than ever to leverage the advantages of 3D printing — such as True-Leveling™, wifi connectivity, wireless control, and an integrated user interface — the M3 comes in two distinct formats targeting both advanced and new users: M3 Independent Dual (M3-ID) and M3 Single Extrusion (M3-SE) .</p>
<p>For businesses and professionals looking for the most advanced functionality available, the M3 Independent Dual offers a faster, more efficient, and more reliable solution to the growing demand for multi-material and soluble-material 3D printing. Additionally, the M3's independent (rather than fixed) dual extrusion system enables users to double production speed for single-material prints using the M3-ID's Mimeo Mode.</p>
<p>For professionals new to 3D printing or for those looking to keep it simple, the M3-SE makes it easier and more cost-effective than ever to harvest the benefits of professional 3D printing. In addition to a host of new features, the MakerGear M3's rigid steel frame offers superior durability and long-term precision while its high-temperature V4 hot end provides extreme material versatility — backed by a 12-month warranty and free, in-house support, the MakerGear M3 is the ultimate workhorse for professional 3D printing.</p>
<p>The MakerGear M3 extends the company’s performance-oriented brand, which has resulted in its products being ranked #1 globally in desktop 3D printing for three consecutive years by 3D Hubs annual 3D printer review. MakerGear’s flagship 3D printer is currently ranked as the #1 “Workhorse 3D Printer” while also standing at the top of 3D Hubs’<span> </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BeCAUn_LmGJubp9h_TokWCO432FAMBzyBEq3Jx0lWY4i1ZvtVov4Z00jWFe5LUw7HOvsIGsz_C-JT4iF7QiX-XX13-mCMWGGHTiqTkNeKsc=" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="3D Printer Index">3D Printer Index</a>.  </p>
<p>MakerGear Founder &amp; CEO Rick Pollack says, “Our new products have the functionality and performance to meet the growing needs of professionals and educators. We have a standing commitment to provide excellent products with expert support. With the M3, we stand firmly behind this philosophy.” Pollack continued, “MakerGear has a long tradition of helping our customers achieve optimal results, and today, we are expanding our footprint with the long awaited M3. And continuing our commitment to our community, we are proud that it is primarily manufactured in and around our headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio.”</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Rick Pollack, Founder and CEO of<span> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.makergear.com/" title="MakerGear">MakerGear</a>, had the unique opportunity to discuss additive manufacturing with two of the world's most influential leaders, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor invited Pollack to meet President Obama and Chancellor Merkel at the opening ceremonies of Hannover Messe, the world's foremost trade fair for industrial technology. The United States is the fair's Partner Country with Germany for the first time in Hannover Messe's history, which has attracted more than 390 businesses and organizations into the U.S. delegation.</p>
<p>A visit to the MakerGear booth (Hall 3, Stand F06, 30, 31 and 32) will provide viewers with a window into the world of applied 3D printing, including the M2, a high-quality, precision, reliable, open-source desktop 3D printer by MakerGear. M2 owners produced many of the exhibition items on display. Product packaging, dental models, prosthetic limbs made by high school students, a heart printed for pediatric research, architectural models, costumes and props are some of the items being exhibited.</p>
<p>"<a rel="nofollow" href="http://jobs-ohio.com/" title="JobsOhio">JobsOhio</a><span> </span>has done outstanding work supporting and retaining companies like MakerGear, and we are honored to be part of Hannover Messe," Pollack said. "To be able to share our story with President Obama and Chancellor Merkel is such a rare opportunity. President Obama has taken additive manufacturing seriously, and he sees the positive effect it is having on so many different industries."</p>
<p>"Thanks to our partners, such as JobsOhio and<span> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.teamneo.org/" title="TeamNEO">TeamNEO</a>, we've created a diverse economy where advanced manufacturing companies like MakerGear can grow and excel," said Lt.
