          <h5><br>
            <p>I've worked with many people who feel constrained by work in a
              formal research environment (I work at a national lab, though only
              part time now that I have Sky's Edge), and I've often daydreamed
              of making my own lab where people can work on whatever they want
              to. That kind of unfettered creativity always wins. But where does
              the money come from? Open source product development, either as a
              direct outcome of inventiveness or as a side-effort to fund
              unmarketable but otherwise remarkable ideas. </p>
          </h5>
          <h5>
            <p> My idea with Sky's Edge is that I could make whatever I feel
              like making, as long as those things can be developed as viable
              products to fund the whole endeavor.The idea of "having a company"
              has always been unsavory to me, and indeed I see Sky's Edge more
              as an open source invention factory than as a company.</p>
            <p><br>
            </p>
          </h5>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not alone. Many others are out there, like Marcin Jakubowski,
            who has come to the same conclusions and has done a lot to enhance
            these ideas. He has a TED talk <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/marcin_jakubowski_open_sourced_blueprints_for_civilization?language=en">here</a>,
            and has started <a href="https://www.opensourceecology.org/">Open
              Source Ecology</a>, the mission of which is to further the idea
            that closed-source product development should be a thing of the
            past.</p>
