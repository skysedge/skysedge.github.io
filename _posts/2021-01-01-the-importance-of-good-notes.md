title: The Importance of Good Notes
author: Justine Haupt

The open source community has a big, big problem with clearly
documenting its work. Technical writing should not be considered
optional. If you create something, explain how to use it from the
beginning, with context, overviews, and little assumed prior
knowledge. Incomprehensibility isn't a sign of brilliance, it's a
sign of the opposite. Consider Feynman!

Now, without context and explanation I present a bunch of random
notes:
