				<div class="content">hello ,<br>
<br>
First of all, please forgive my bad English, I come from France<br>
<br>
I have always liked this kind of project and I came across your "rotary cell-phone", which I find really original and surprising and I would like to know if I were to order it one day if it was compatible with the French telephone networks...<br>
<br>
we operate at home, in 3G (2028) and 4G currently</div>

				<div class="content">hello everyone, <br>
<br>
sorry for my bad english, I may have formulated my subject poorly, I am writing here so as not to repeat a thread,<br>
I just came to ask if your rotary phone <br>
was compatible with our fr networks, <br>
we have 3G (2028)<br>
and 4G (currently)<br>
<br>
and does the purchasing system work? because my paypal displays an error message</div>

				<div class="content">Hey, sorry for the delay. I don't think anyone as yet can say for sure that the phone will work on FR networks, but we also don't know any reason why it <em class="text-italics">shouldn't</em>. The modem we use is a "global" version which should be compatible with the LTE infrastructure in France. The question is if the carriers for some reason decide to block our IMEI. Really we just need someone to try it!</div>

We'd certainly like to. It's just that we are rather short-staffed (we're only volunteers!) at Sky's Edge that I'm not sure when we'll have production going fast enough for that. So at the minute, we are prioritizing kit orders.</div>
