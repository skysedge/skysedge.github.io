				<div class="content">Hey everyone, I was able to recieve a call connecting to the Iliad network in Italy using the serial interface and AT commands. at first nothing was working but a friend of mine figured out that there was a setting that needed to be toggled in the modem with an AT command next step is to get the firmware that let the phone actually work with the modem so I can make calls and recieve them directly from the phone.<br>
<br>
The setting that needs to be changed is the ATH one see below.<br>
<br>
If anyone has the firmware that lets the Rusp work with the modem please share</div>

Interesting. I would love to hear more about why this command is needed here; it seems at first glance to be related only to hanging up calls, not placing or receiving them.<br>

We're working on it here: <a href="https://github.com/skysedge/rusp_firmware" class="postlink">https://github.com/skysedge/rusp_firmware</a>. It should be able to place and receive calls, but is far from complete.</div>
