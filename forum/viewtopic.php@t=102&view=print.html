				<div class="content">Hello hello. <br>
<br>
I'm thinking wifi hotspot (or tethered usb-c hotspot) might be a very handy thing. What I mean is: the Rotary Un-Smartphone would share its sim-card's internet data access to other deviced near by, wirelessly or with a cable between the phone and the other device (a laptop computer for example). I ran a forum search and it seems it's been mentioned <a href="https://skysedge.com/viewtopic.php?p=14#p14" class="postlink">here</a> before.<br>
<br>
But I understand that it's maybe a lot of work too. So instead of wishing it to be true what I'm enquiring is: is it technically possible? You know, if some years later an official (or a custom) firmaware is released with a wifi (or wired) hotspot support, is that a feasible scenario?<br>
<br>
All the best, to all of us, thanks!</div>

It's certainly technically possible with a hardware upgrade, but the current hardware doesn't have a WiFi radio.</div>

Hi awsfeddie,<br>

				<div class="content">Yeahhh a lot of people have emailed me asking for this kind of functionality. Now that basic cell service is problematic in the US I admit to regretting not implementing it in the first place, but for now the priority has to be restoring cell connectivity.</div>
