				<div class="content">Recent article by the BBC about the neo-Luddites looking to disconnect from blue light overload and "touch grass" with simpler communication technology.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240515-the-dumbphones-people-want-are-hard-to-find" class="postlink">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/2024 ... rd-to-find</a><br>
<br>
I thought this was a relevant take on something that we here knew for awhile, seems like we are legion and growing! Why can't old be done new, and why does getting "less" features relegate one to end-of-life technology??<br>
<br>
PS - I reached out to the editor as well as the author about the RUSP Project and Justine's (and team) work, maybe a future update will include this slice of neo-Luddite nirvana.</div>
