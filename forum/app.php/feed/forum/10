So, as someone who has worked a little on the firmware for the RUSP, here is my perspective.<br><br>Dan mentioned this in another thread:<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>From what I understand about the phone working on US networks, the issue is Carriers  have added the requirement that all phones pass certain independent lab testing before being allowed on their networks.  That testing requires the FCC license to be granted/completed.  <br><br>The initial kits that have gone out are pretty much experimental to see if the assembly process works for people and if anyone can find a network that they can operate on.  As far as I can tell, most are working on these as a secondary project when they have the spare time so there haven't been any reports of success.</div></blockquote>Until very recently, this was Justine's experience. But in the process of assembling some new phones, and after we decided to start rewriting the firmware, we actually got network registration (and calling, and receiving calls, and sending texts via the serial console....) to work. Or at least we did with one AT&amp;T prepaid SIM card, though I don't think it's limited to just AT&amp;T. We have not done any independent lab tests, or gotten any FCC licenses. So I now have no idea why it wasn't working before. It's possible the old firmware or hardware was simply buggy—when I get a chance, I'll try testing my T-Mobile SIM with both the new and old versions of the firmware. It's also possible that Justine did her earlier testing without the auxiliary antenna attached (which is better than the daughterboard antenna), or without the battery (which might be needed to power LARA's current spikes). Either way I think it was so long ago that whatever test configuration that first led Justine to conclude that the carriers were blocking us is lost to time.<br><br>In no way do I want to imply that if you buy a phone, it will definitely work on your carrier! I'm just sharing that somehow we actually managed to find success. If you'd like to compare new and old firmware, the new one is here: <a href="https://github.com/skysedge/rusp_firmware" class="postlink">https://github.com/skysedge/rusp_firmware</a><br><br>TL;DR: a couple weeks ago while we were messing around we discovered "oh, huh, it works" and I for one haven't yet figured out why it does now but didn't before <img class="smilies" src="https://skysedge.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">imyxh</a> — Thu Jun 20, 2024 5:17 am</p><hr />

Since we're using the LARA-R6001, my understanding is that technology-wise it <em class="text-italics">should</em> work with Pakistan. From what I'm reading Pakistan uses the 850 MHz and 1800 MHz LTE bands, which are both supported by the LARA. However, if your carrier does any sort of IMEI allowlisting (and whether they do even in the US seems to be a point of confusion) then all bets are off.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">imyxh</a> — Thu Jun 20, 2024 4:55 am</p><hr />
