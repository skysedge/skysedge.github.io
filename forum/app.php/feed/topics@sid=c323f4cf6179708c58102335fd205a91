Hi all!<br><br>I’ve been following this project for many years and decided to pull the trigger and buy it… then I saw the issue with connectivity to NA mobile networks.<br><br>Does anyone know which ones have been tested so far?  Or is it just simply not permitted on the network?<br><br>Is there an update on the regulatory approval?  I’d be happy to try a bunch of different companies if it looks like approval is going to take much longer.<br><br>Justine, if you’re reading this, I think this is a piece of tech art.  Great job on creating this!<br><br>Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=189">melduforx</a> — Fri Jun 07, 2024 12:25 am — Replies 1 — Views 441</p><hr />

Progress on the build has been rather smooth so far except for one issue. The dial returns way too fast. When I first assembled all the mechanical gear-y bits, the dial returned at a perfectly appropriate speed, but later on it snaps right back upon release. I completely disassembled the governor — where I'm pretty sure the issue lies — and cleaned the spring (which did have some grease on it) with alcohol, verified that it only turns the correct direction, and reassembled it. While I was first assembling the governor my only concern was that I may have cut the PTFE rods too short; could that be an issue? They do stand proud of the aluminum counterweights by at least a few tenths of a mm.<br><br>Any ideas or advice? (Did I miss something painfully obvious?)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">cehq</a> — Thu May 30, 2024 3:05 am — Replies 1 — Views 6879</p><hr />

Hi. I have a question as to the fastening of the bell arm to the daughterboard, the kit was a couple of m2 screws short, but after locating two spare ones (tip- check all boxes and drawers, chances are some might just hang around in the corners buried in fluff) I have noticed that the daughterboard has nylon washer and nut prefixed, is this an upgrade on the daughterboard that deviates from the manual, or am I in some other way daft? So no nylstop nut on this one? <br><br>As an aside, really good project to do with both young and adult kids, the cool wonkiness of this project captivates their attention! <br><br>Cheers, sturla<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=170">S_Bang</a> — Sun May 12, 2024 2:39 pm — Replies 1 — Views 607</p><hr />
