Yup, that was me by email!  With the replacement parts it went together just fine.  I'm guessing that, with as many times as I had to re-assemble the dialer and work on that spring, it must have just been an unusual amount of wear and tear.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=133">Navalynt</a> — Sun May 21, 2023 7:47 pm</p><hr />

Hi Navalynt,<br><br>Not sure if you sent me an email directly or not... if it wasn't you someone else had the same problem so there must be an important misunderstanding about the assembly process.<br><br>Basically, I don't know how this could happen if it's assembled right, so I'm going to go ahead and send you replacement parts so you can try again. Can you DM or email me with your name?<br><br>~Justine<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">justine</a> — Fri May 19, 2023 11:30 pm</p><hr />

Hello,<br><br>received my kit on Saturday. This probably makes me the first one outside of U.S. (Germany). I will be on a lot of business trips the next weeks, but will nevertheless try to put together the kit. Will be interesting to see whether it works with German networks...<br><br>P.S.: got one silver and one gold bell. Is this ok?<br><br>Thanks Justine for the hard work!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=131">bertram</a> — Tue May 02, 2023 9:27 am</p><hr />

I've been sitting on mine for a week, as I needed to get my work bench cleaned off.  <br><br>Aside from some glue mishaps, it's gone quite well.  I've gotten to the governor stage but either I didn't get the PTFE filament or I lost it.  If anyone knows the diameter of the filament, it'd help me find a suitable replacement.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=130">Dan W</a> — Mon May 01, 2023 9:17 pm</p><hr />

I had a bit of an issue getting the dial assembly to fit onto the motherboard because I had, foolishly, glued the dial hub to the dial shaft.  I had assumed that the cardstock I used would be thick enough when putting on the dial hub.  But, when I went to put the dial assembly on the motherboard, the going barrel didn't have enough clearance.  Fortunately, I was able to go in and dremel the glue off and get the dial hub to move on the shaft.  At this point, I am a little confused/concerned about what is going to hold the going barrel at the right distance from the mother board...just friction between the dial hub and shaft?

Yeahhh the definite inclusion of the hot glue gun was kind of last minute on my part. There's a definite workaround for the OLED display, but the thing with the antenna casing is that it's hard to superglue the edge without the white CA residue getting everywhere from the superglue. I'd like to keep it simple, so now I wonder if I shouldn't include a small quantity of some 2-part epoxy to cover all the cases instead of the super glue.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">justine</a> — Sat Apr 29, 2023 2:48 am</p><hr />
