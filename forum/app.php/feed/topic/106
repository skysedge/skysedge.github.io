Hi Jacky<br><br>Ditto! I couldn't even remember when I ordered a kit (9 April 23). I'm also not in a hurry, I understand the challenges, but when I retired last March I figured I might have time for the RUSP so I placed an order.<br><br>I was very moved when I saw Justine's latest YouTube video and I suspect the Covid challenges were underplayed.<br><br>For those that received kits, did you receive notice of shipment? I need to make sure I'm around to pay the duty (I'm in the UK).<br><br>Steve<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=156">SteveC</a> — Fri Nov 17, 2023 3:08 am</p><hr />

Just posting briefly to say hello, as I'm one who ordered a global kit, which I understand will take a bit longer. Trying to remember which option group I'm in, but I wasn't in a hurry, so whichever one was the "I'm happy to wait until the initial teething troubles are over" group.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=154">Jacky Tar</a> — Fri Nov 17, 2023 1:36 am</p><hr />
