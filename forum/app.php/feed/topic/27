Hi,<br><br>I would love to contribute to the NZ2 project by developing micro-ROS support to make it out-of-the-box compatible with ROS systems. Of course this would be made optional in case the user wishes not to use ROS. If the NZ2 were to host native ROS-fluency it would be the world's 1st commercially available, open source brushless controller that doesn't require installing dedicated drivers manually. The ROS world needs a plug-and-play robotic motor controller.<br><br>Especially now that rosserial is absent from ROS 2, this is all the more relevant!<br><br>Justine, I emailed you about this but I know you have piles of messages in your inbox, so I thought I'd post here for a better chance of catching your attention  <img class="smilies" src="https://skysedge.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="17" alt="8-)" title="Cool"> You can find my email by searching 'micro-ROS'...<br><br>All the best,<br>Avi Brown<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=110">avi</a> â€” Mon Nov 14, 2022 3:16 pm</p><hr />
