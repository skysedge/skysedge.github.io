Extremely well done.<br>I was impressed that on installing my current phone Sim, the phone was recognised immediately by the  Telstra network<br>here in Australia. Wife could get a ring tone on every attempt to call the Unsmart. Whilst my Unsmart didnt ring, nor could I actually <br>accept the call, I am sure it is a software issue that Justine will resolve.<br>The only real challenge with my build, the hammer bell arm when positioned and tightened in place, distorted the Mother and Sister <br>board alignment, and caused the dial mechanism to jam.
