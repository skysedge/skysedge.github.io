<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hey everyone, I was able to recieve a call connecting to the Iliad network in Italy using the serial interface and AT commands. at first nothing was working but a friend of mine figured out that there was a setting that needed to be toggled in the modem with an AT command next step is to get the firmware that let the phone actually work with the modem so I can make calls and recieve them directly from the phone.<br><br>The setting that needs to be changed is the ATH one see below.</div></blockquote>Interesting. I would love to hear more about why this command is needed here; it seems at first glance to be related only to hanging up calls, not placing or receiving them.<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>If anyone has the firmware that lets the Rusp work with the modem please share</div></blockquote>We're working on it here: <a href="https://github.com/skysedge/rusp_firmware" class="postlink">https://github.com/skysedge/rusp_firmware</a>. It should be able to place and receive calls, but is far from complete.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">imyxh</a> — Thu Jun 20, 2024 4:37 am</p><hr />
