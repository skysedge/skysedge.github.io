				<div class="content">Mail to <a href="mailto:info@skysedge.com">info@skysedge.com</a> is indeed undeliverable, last I checked.<br>
<br>
I ordered two RUSP kits around May of 2022. I thought they would come in November, as was the estimate at the time of my purchase; but I see from the most recent youtube video update that there were some bad production runs and delays due to chip shortages.<br>
<br>
The delays were unforseen, and actually I forgot I used a temporary e-mail address which subsequently expired, so I never got updates on the order status from that e-mail address! And I didn't realize this until earlier this year! I was sortof expecting the kits to just show up at some point.<br>
<br>
I've tried forwarding the order confirmation e-mails to <a href="mailto:justine@skysedge.com">justine@skysedge.com</a> a few months back ; no response (who likes e-mail anyways? I sure don't)<br>
<br>
I also tried to forward to <a href="mailto:info@skysedge.com">info@skysedge.com</a> but those messages bounced back, undeliverable.<br>
<br>
My most recent attempt was to contact her at her work e-mail, but only to ask what the right e-mail to contact her at is. Surely she doesn't want skysedge related e-mails at her bnl e-mail.<br>
<br>
I think the kits will be well worth the wait. I'm not upset about it, but I don't know why the lead time for new orders is 3 months when I'm still waiting for these two kits ordered two years ago?</div>

I'm sure there's an explanation, but some communication would be great. The last update I saw was that she was dealing with a bunch of requirements to get it approved to connect to US networks. I can't even begin to imagine the hassle. Still, it would be nice to know what's going on.</div>

Anyone have any idea what's going on with this project. I placed an order in early December thinking it'd only be a few months, but reading magnetosphere's comment has me a little worried. I really don't mind waiting, but the site says there's a three month backlog not several years.<br>

I think in my case, this delay was most likely due to an oversight on my part - i.e. an e-mail that I missed which i assume must have been sent after the original november 2022 expected delivery date passed ; or perhaps even before then if the delay was anticipated. What can she really be expected to do if someone doesn't answer their e-mail? Maybe send a letter? LOL<br>
<br>
Since my previous post here, I sent another e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@skysedge.com">info@skysedge.com</a> and it did not bounce back ; however I have yet to receive a reply.<br>
<br>
My only serious (<em class="text-italics">yet totally speculative and unfounded</em>) concern or fear is the possibility that Justine may have fallen ill with some serious condition since the last video update - God forbid! There's a lot of that going around these days. Similarly, if anyone in her family had fallen ill with a serious condition, it might affect production as well.<br>
<br>
I can scarcely imagine the stress that an undertaking such as this might cause a person. It's apparent from the last video update that things did not go <em class="text-italics">exactly</em> as planned. But I believe everything will work out. At least, I have my fingers crossed.<br>
<br>
So I'm wishing you all the best, and especially good health, Justine. Whenever you might read this.</div>

I would also like to know what's going on. I bought in December 2022 as well. Still being patient, because I believe in the project, but I'd sure like an update.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<div class="content">Justine just sent out an email update to the RUSP mail list; it hit my In Box today.<br>
<br>
Reader's Digest Condensed Version:<br>
Option A kits are being sent out now, Option B complete phones may be sent out later on this year?<br>
<br>
Sky's Edge has four new employees and an intern. They are working on phones and kits and (more to the topic) helping to answer emails!<br>
<br>
If "<a href="mailto:info@skysedge.com">info@skysedge.com</a>" is bouncing, try "<a href="mailto:support@skysedge.com">support@skysedge.com</a>" instead. As a Last Resort, try "<a href="mailto:justine@skysedge.com">justine@skysedge.com</a>."<br>
