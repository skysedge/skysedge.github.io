<br>
Ditto! I couldn't even remember when I ordered a kit (9 April 23). I'm also not in a hurry, I understand the challenges, but when I retired last March I figured I might have time for the RUSP so I placed an order.<br>
<br>
I was very moved when I saw Justine's latest YouTube video and I suspect the Covid challenges were underplayed.<br>
<br>
For those that received kits, did you receive notice of shipment? I need to make sure I'm around to pay the duty (I'm in the UK).<br>
