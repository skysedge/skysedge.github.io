				<h3>Missing Parts</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun May 07, 2023 11:35 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Dan W</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I know a couple missing parts were mentioned in the "Received my kit!" thread, but if anyone else might be missing things, it can go here!<br>
<br>
I either didn't get my PTFE filament or lost it.  (I'm pretty good at that some days)<br>
<br>
If anyone would be willing to tell me the diameter of the filament I'd be willing to procure my own so I can continue with the build.</div>

				<div class="content">My lame excuse for internet sleuthing has revealed to me that the diameter is likely 1.75mm.  However, PTFE filament seems to be a rather specialty product, as the closest thing I found that fits the bill is a PC/PTFE filament that is typically a bit cost prohibitive.  So unless there's an approved substitute that I can use, I'll just sit tight.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
I'll go ahead and send you some, sorry! I called it PTFE and got it on McMaster-Carr but you have to get a pretty long piece of it and you need so little, so I'll drop it in the mail. Also, I'm trying to remember if it's *actually* PTFE (might not be).</div>

				<div class="content">The directional spring(s) arrived today.  However, it looks like the post office ignored the "Non Machinable" stamp on the envelope.  I'm not sire they will work after being flattened.<br>

				<div class="content">Got the filament squared away and ran into a snag getting ready to put the two boards together. I read the step, "Orient the Cam Gear so that the lobe is facing the limit switchâ€™s roller." and thought: wait, what switch?
<div class="inline-attachment">
			
		
				<dl class="file">
			<dt class="attach-image"><img src="download/file.php@id=7" class="postimage" alt="MissingSwitch.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt>
						<dd>MissingSwitch.jpg (252.55 KiB) Viewed 15230 times</dd>
		</dl>
		
		
			</div>

So anyway, if you can send me a switch, I'll get it attached and continue with the assembly process! <br>
<br>
(A little soldering never hurt anyone)<br>
(I'll get to try out my modified extraction fan too)</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure if I lost the long spacer or didn't recieve it. Does anyone have a height measurement for it? Is there a revised height? Thanks!</div>
