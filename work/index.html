            <p>Why do we build particle accelerators? Why do we have
              restaurants? Why do we go to work every day? We think we go to our
              respective jobs all day, every day, to make money. But the point
              is to be happy. That's it. A restaurateur wants to make money so
              they can have a home and feed their family and do the things they
              want to do. An engineer working on a space ship goes to work to
              make money so they can have a home and feed their family and do
              the things they want to do. The fact that civilization has set up
              a system whereby we exchange money to make things happen and make
              everyone go to work in the process doesn't change that the end
              result of work is supposed to be happiness.</p>
            <p>Space travel, quarterly profits, production quotas... none of it
              <i>really</i> matters. It's just a game. It's giving us all
              something to do while we're here on Earth. We need to fool
              ourselves into thinking that's not the case insofar as it's
              necessary to keep the game running, but we must also remind
              ourselves from time to time that deep down, the satisfaction, self
              growth, and happiness are the only really important things, and
              the instant a job gets to be artificially stressful (e.g. due to
              artifices of bureaucracy and not from challenges intrinsic to the
              work), the managers have steered the organization poorly.</p>
