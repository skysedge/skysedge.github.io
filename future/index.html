              <p>Concertinas are expensive instruments. A design for an open
                source high-quality (e.g. as nice as a Lachenal or Wheatstone)
                has been a back-burner project of mine for some time. Eventually
                I'll finish the design and build some and post the information.
                I also have an idea for including internal sympathetic strings
                to richen the tone. For a sense of the look of it, the end
                pieces will be based on the "3d printed wood" end pieces
                described <a href="https://www.justine-haupt.com/Concertina/">here</a>.</p>

                this will take a <i>lot</i> of developement to turn into a

                and cinematographers know that to truly create beautiful images,
                one needs to paint with the light, and yet the options one has
                for creatively lighting one's living space are almost
                non-existant. To witness what good lighting can do for an
                environment, go to any of the demonstration living spaces in an
                Ikea. But one can go much farther than that. Much further.</p>

              <p>One of the things everyone pretends about in life is the idea
                of home ownership. At least in the US, you can't! It's bullshit!
                Yes, owning a home gives you the right to build or modify it to
                be exactly what you want within the constraints of local
                building codes, but occupation of one's home is dependent on
                one's ability to pay property taxes (forever). If you stop
                paying the taxes you'll be kicked off of your own property. So
                it's not really ownership, is it? If you want to own your own
                living space such that no one else can ever legally take it away
                from you, what options are there? Well, boats come to mind.</p>
              <p>Living aboard a boat isn't everyone's cup of tea, but sailing
                was a big part of my upbringing and I've never been able to
                totally expunge the idea of "living aboard" from my brain.</p>
              <p> Common rebuttal: "Why would you want to confine your entire
                living space to a tiny, damp, rocking cabin?" As I see it, if
                you're going to make a sailboat your home it should <i>not</i>
                be something like a common 30-something foot sloop. That would
                be stupid. It's your HOME. In my area home's cost like $400K. To
                do it right I would want to spend about as much on a home-boat
                as on a conventional house, and you can get a <i>pretty big</i>
                used sailboat in good condition for that much... Like 70'. But
                if you go about looking at boats that big you discover the
                frustrating fact that they mostly seem to be designed for
                charter operations, which means that instead of one nice, big,
                usable living space, they pack in as many tiny/cramped living
                spaces as possible. I would <i>love</i> the opportunity to do a
                liveaboard-oriented ground-up design of a sailing vessel. I
                suspect that you could have a nice home with almost no
                compromises.</p>
              <p>Still, I doubt my husband and I would ever actually live on a
                boat, haha. Cats... the need for a workshop... love of the
                winter, etc, but there's a niche of people for whom this
                lifestyle would be well suited but for whom typical sailboat
                designs are lacking.</p>

              Electric VTOL Aircraft "Standard Form"?</b></h4>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-md-10">
            <h5 class="text-center">
              <p>There's a lot of interest in electric aircraft now with the
                expectation that a breakthrough in battery energy density is
                forthcoming. Almost every aerospace company is working on
                scaling up "quadcopter technology" to produce human-flight
                capable electric VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft.
                Like the early days of aviation, there are as many airframe
                architectures as their are aircraft designers, but just as fixed
                wing aircraft (and helicopters) eventually fell into standard
                forms, I feel that in 50 years we'll look back and wonder how
                anyone could have imagined an EVTOL looking like anything but
                what it will look like in 50 years. </p>
              <p>It should be safe (beyond simply having redundant systems,
                because powered lift is a scary thing). It should attain to the
                speeds of conventional fixed-wing aircraft. And it <u>needs to
                  be quiet</u>. External active noise cancellation needs to
                become a "thing" soon if we don't want local governments to
                regulate EVTOLs out of existance before they get off the ground.
                And finally, it should look natural... it should make people say
                "of course, that's what it should look like".</p>
              <p>I hope to have a ~1/4 scale (unmanned) demonstrator in the next
                couple years and eventually a full-scale prototype for my own
                use.</p>

        <h6>Sky's Edge is a subsidiary of Lightsmith Scientific LLC. Wait, why?
          Because when I first decided to start a company I decided on the name
          Lightsmith Scientific and formed it as an LLC. A few years later I
          thought of Sky's Edge, which comes from an Alastair Reynolds book, and
          liked it much better. So on paper Lightsmith Scientific has a "DBA" in
          NY state for doing business as Sky's Edge. <br>
