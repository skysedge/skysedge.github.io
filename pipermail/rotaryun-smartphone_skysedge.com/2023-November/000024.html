<PRE>Hello customers and subscribers,

Some of you may have already noticed that I released a YouTube video 
yesterday, which is mainly a reflection of and update about the phone 
journey: <A HREF="https://youtu.be/zX7TdufZlTA?si=8I57ILRKzC-8GYOc">https://youtu.be/zX7TdufZlTA?si=8I57ILRKzC-8GYOc</A>

Here's a rundown on the status of Option A (experimental) orders:

- About 50 have gone out so far
- The orders that have gone out represent a range of global regions
- Builders are documenting their progress on this forum: 
<A HREF="https://skysedge.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&amp;sid=d490b357adb8f4f6e69ffe6fac78df14">https://skysedge.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&amp;sid=d490b357adb8f4f6e69ffe6fac78df14</A> 
&lt;<A HREF="https://skysedge.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&amp;sid=d490b357adb8f4f6e69ffe6fac78df14">https://skysedge.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&amp;sid=d490b357adb8f4f6e69ffe6fac78df14</A>&gt;
- I have the impression from the kinds of comments and questions I'm 
getting from early builders that the assembly process is more 
challenging than I wanted it to be. I have design changes in mind for 
the future, but for the time being, this is how it is.
- One of the first customers to complete his build, in Australia, 
reports that his SIM card works and that the phone registers to the 
network. The as-shipped firmware is buggy and I'm working with him to 
debug and get the phone to actually place a call.
- It's exciting to me that the regulatory situation in the US isn't 
universal.
- All of the kits shipped so far were manufactured at my previous (Rocky 
Point, NY) location.
- The manufacturing line at the new location in Riverhead, NY, is almost 
up and running.
- In the September update I said the Option A orders would&#160; start going 
out in October, that the equipment would be ready to use in the new 
location also in October, and that all Option A kits would be filled in 
November. That's not totally on track, but also not nearly so behind as 
I have been before. I'll be filling another 20 or so orders with stock 
produced at Rocky Point, which will go out this month for sure, and as 
soon as the production line is going I'll be doing more batches and 
trying to get the rest out in December.

Since I always get the question &quot;what about the certification status&quot;, 
the answer remains mid-2024.

Other points:
- I'm soon going to release a spinoff product (this is mentioned very 
briefly in the above video), which will be *just* the rotary mechanism 
with minimal electronics needed to use it, for makers interested in 
incorporating a newly manufactured rotary dial into their project. This 
is a very easy/low-distraction/no-scope-creep thing to do because I 
already have all these parts, they work, and I can send them out 
immediately as orders come in.
- This should help fund ongoing operations for the company, which is 
somewhat critical as sales of the RUSP itself is rightfully quite low.
- Now that there's a building, hiring people to help with the day to day 
is a critical next step, and I'm also hoping to attract some kind of 
external funding to make that happen.
