<PRE>Greetings subscribers and customers,

Since my last update 
&lt;<A HREF="../2023-July/000022.html">http://skysedge.com/pipermail/rotaryun-smartphone_skysedge.com/2023-July/000022.html</A>&gt;, 
I've resolved the problems I described with my manufacturing equipment 
and have produced the most sizeable batch of phones to date. I'll be 
getting these experimental/beta/option-A kits in the mail in the*next 
couple weeks as I can*! Not quite by the end of August as I said before, 
but at least the kits are produced.

My plan was to fill *all* the option A (experimental/beta) orders with 
this batch, but the perpetual specter of incompetence continues to haunt 
me and I ran out of a chip that I inventoried wrong (turns out I have 
lots of the ATMega1280-8CU, which I can't use, instead of the 
ATmega1280-16AU that I need). Please don't email me about how they 
should be close enough in terms of compatibility; The max baud rate of 
the 8MHz variant can't keep up with the cell modem, wrong package size 
notwithstanding.

Anyway, I only managed to produce about half the experimental kits 
requested. This is just a matter of buying more of the right component, 
which is available, thank goodness, so I plan to produce the remaining 
unfilled experimental/option-A kits as soon as all my machines are set 
up again... I'm disconnecting and moving everything out of my mom's 
basement and into the new facility this week, and I want to have 
everything set up and calibrated etc. in the new place by mid-September, 
being ready to start the next production batch around the end of the 
month. I think that means the rest of the experimental/option-A/beta 
kits would be in the mail in October.

For all orders that were placed *in or after* *March of this year*, 
you're in the aforementioned next/October batch. This is clearly later 
than the promised &quot;summer&quot; timeline I had on the website, so please 
email me if you'd like a refund.

As for the &quot;not experimental&quot; fully functional and assembled phones 
(&quot;option B&quot;), again, this is going to be a while (think mid 2024). It's 
a big deal.

As always, if anyone wants a *refund*, please, please ask for one (email 
me here at <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/rotaryun-smartphone_skysedge.com.html">justine at skysedge.com</A>) rather than get frustrated or mad about 
the delays.

~Justine
