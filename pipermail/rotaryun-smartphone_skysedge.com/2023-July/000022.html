<PRE>Greetings phone friends and, increasingly, phrenemies,

I know it's been a little too long since I've sent an update.

Since the first 11 &quot;beta/option A&quot; units went out, no additional ones 
have been sent, but that will change soon. I'm working on getting ALL of 
the Option A requests out in the next batch, with new purchases since 
March going out soon thereafter.

I tried to start this production batch yesterday, but then my pick and 
place machine broke down again. Literally last night, the monitor just 
went black with no warning. I tried mouse wiggles, restarting, swapping 
out the monitor, and swapping out the motherboard (which has on-board 
video) with a spare I have on hand, all without joy. I checked the hard 
drive today and it seems the data is intact, so I don't know what's 
wrong yet. It's the kind of thing where I think &quot;people are going to 
start not believing all the problems I'm having... no one has these many 
problems&quot;. For what it's worth, a capture of the moment with a spare 
monitor and the motherboard swapped out...

Assuming I can get whatever part I need,&#160;then I'm thinking all the next 
orders will wind up going out in August now (as opposed to this month, 
which was my plan until yesterday).

Okay, so what about getting the regulatory certifications taken care of? 
Come on Justine where are we with this?!

Right now my focus is (to me, HAS TO BE) on restructuring the company 
for sustainability and moving equipment to my new facility, getting 
ready to hire people, continuing to produce experimental/beta kits as 
they're ordered, and releasing an updated version of my other (robotics) 
products so I can fund ongoing RUSP refunds and keep the company 
afloat... stuff like that. The certification process needs to be part of 
the long game. I'm sorry if that doesn't accord with expectations but it 
just has to be.

If you'd like a refund, as always, please email me with that word in the 
title. If you'd just like to send a note, letting me know if there's no 
need to respond is always appreciated with the letters NNTR in the 
subject. I've been trying to get caught up on emails on a weekly basis, 
but sometimes it slips to two.
