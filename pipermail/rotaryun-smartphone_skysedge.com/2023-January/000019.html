<PRE>Hello rotary phone friends,

I'm just waiting on the actual *actual* final version of the 
motherboards and daugtherboards from my fab house now. These will be 
assembled in my basement factory starting next week, and the first 
orders will be going out in February. I'm getting emails lately 
(rightfully so) asking when I think orders will be arriving based on 
customers' place in line. Here's an estimate based on your order date:

If you ordered by: 	Your kit will be shipped by:
1/16/21 	2/22/23
2/20/21
	3/1/23
6/29/21 	3/8/23
12/30/21 	3/29/23
4/28/22 	4/5/23
5/26/22 	4/12/23
9/6/22 	4/19/23
9/14/22 	4/26/23
1/24/23 	6/14/23



An update from previous emails about bug fixes and the impact on the 
phone's feature set
- The auxiliary audio jack has been fixed. Basically most of the world 
uses one standard for how to wire a 3.5mm jack for microphone and 
headphones (called CTIA), and China has another (called OMTP), and the 
only jack that will fit in the RUSP due to mechanical constraints uses 
the latter. OMTP standard headphones are uncommon in most markets, but 
of course Amazon has everything and if you're a headset user that has a 
particular one you prefer, CTIA-to-OMTP converter jacks exist. 
Otherwise, one can order an actual OMTP headset.

Buts that remain outstanding:
- Speakerphone functionality is still a maybe. Hardware-wise I think 
it's good now, but there's firmware tweaks to be understood, and a 
subsequent firmware update (via the USB-C port) may fix this.

Other notes:
-The assembly manual has been coming along, with illustrations and 
photos being added as I get to it. That's linked from the website, but 
here's the direct link again if interested:

-I'm working on shooting the assembly guide video (a helpful but not 
strictly necessary supplement to the written assembly instructions)
