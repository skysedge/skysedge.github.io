Subject: [Robotics] NearZero (low-speed brushless motor controller) Update:
 NZ1B
Message-ID: <bc8ea7ed-a01d-89b7-dcd4-d7352b249c7d@skysedge.com>

Hello all,

If you're receiving this, you explicitly subscribed for updates to my 
(Sky's Edge) robotics products, although this is the very first update 
I've sent in three years. If you'd like to unsubscribe, please go here:

I've been promising and procrastinating on NearZero2 development for a 
couple years now, mainly due to other product obligations, but it's time 
for that to change.

To remind, the NZ2 will have FOC, 30A/channel, 7-55V supply voltage, and 
more interfaces than the NZ1 (like CAN bus). I'd also like to provide 
power-expansion boards to let it handle 60, or perhaps 90A per channel.

But on account of my aforementioned other obligations, progress with 
that has been slow. So in the mean time I decided it's probably a 
sensible idea to re-release the NZ1 with some low-hanging-fruit 
improvements.

Long story short: Expect to see the NearZero1B available for purchase in 
a few months.
