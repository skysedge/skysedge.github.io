        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-center"> <br>
          <p>Why is it that many devices are no longer available in a high
            quality form? Well made, reliable, basic bedside alarm clocks used
            to be available in any department store but can no longer be found.
            Yes, you can buy an alarm clock, but you'll find that the plastic is
            cheap, the buttons are unintuitively laid out and possibly
            unreliable, the display is too bright for a dark-adjusted eye, and
            the audio quality is poor. </p>
          <p>Did they forget the recipe?</p>
          <p>Yes, the recipes are lost because the companies that produced these
            went on to other things, or because each new generation of engineers
            wants to make their own version of [insert device here], so instead
            of benefiting from decades of refinement in engineering or user
            interface design, each new product line starts from scratch while
            countless excellent designs (the product of countless thousands of
            person-years of engineering effort) are locked away in the files of
            various companies, or lost to history. That alone is bad enough, but
            in the current era of compressed product development timelines and
            especially poor quality assurance, there's just no room for quality
            in anything but top-tier technology (smartphones, TVs, etc). Imagine
            if, instead, each company could learn from each other company and
            only make changes that objectively improve the user experience?</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about patents. They actually suck, both for
            encouraging progress and for benefiting the inventor. I often get
            questions like "oh are you going to patent such and such" and my
            answer is NO. Even once awarded, all a patent does is to give the
            inventor the legal footing to prosecute alleged infringers. There
            are no "patent police" that will stand up for you and assure you
            have the right to your invention. If infringement is suspected a
            lawyer <i>needs</i> to be brought in.</p>
          <p><i>What is the point of a patent? </i> To give credit to the
            inventor as well as monetary incentive, yes? </p>
          <p>The open source culture is actually much better at crediting
            inventors/originators than patents are. This is similar to
            scientific culture, in which discoveries are shared and there's
            usually no question as to who did the discovering. Contrast this
            with patents, which are extremely costly to obtain not only in
            dollars but also in time, and where not having one is often seen as
            a barrier to going to market. Consider what that means in
            competitive global economy with compressed development cycles where
            a competitor can sell tens of thousands of units and then exit
            before a cease and desist letter even gets drafted.</p>
          <p>Now here's where the real blasphemy starts Is it really right that
            a patent holder should have the exclusive rights to their invention
            for 17-20 years? This means that, by law, the best ideas are
            withheld from exactly the kind of widespread development that <u>all</u>
            of the best ideas have depended on. Imagine if the personal computer
            was prevented from being developed and sold beyond the walls of a
            single company. The success of the personal computer <i>depended</i>
            on the multiple agents working in parallel to explore the
            application space. What's the point of having an invention that's
            prevented from becoming a sensation? To quote Linus Torvalds: </p>
          <p><q> <i><b>I often compare open source to science. To where science
                  took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and
                  improving on other peoples’ ideas and making it into what
                  science is today and the incredible advances that we have had.
                  And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness
                  was something you didn’t do.</b></i></q> </p>
          <p>Corollary: None of the really <em>good</em> inventions are
            patent-able. None of them. None. Not one. If someone invents "X"
            next best thing, do you <em>really</em> think that other companies
            aren't going to try to produce their own versions of it? It's going
            to happen whether parts of the invention are protected or not.
            There's always, <em>always</em> a way around. Consider how many
            different companies are making robotic vacuums, not to mention the
            no-name ones made in countries that don't honor international patent
            law. Even when someone has some great new technology that they
            expect to make a big impact, usually they pursue patenting features
            <em>of</em> the invention and not the total idea because of how
            patent law works. In every way, the system is broken, useless, or
            unnecessary. </p>
          <p>There's a good example of an invention that <em>was</em>
            effectively patented in a way that protected the company that
            invented it, and that's <b>3D printing</b>. Scott Crumb (co-founder
            of Stratasys) invented FDM printing in 1989. Let me repeat that. The
            technology behind desktop 3D printing was invented in 1989. <b>That's
              what patents do for the world.</b> Oh and now that 3D printing has
            become an open-source sensation, Stratasys is doing better than
            ever.</p>
          <p>Even if you want to make an argument for patents, I would argue
            that it should be done differently. I would say that the period of
            protection should be in the range of 3 - 7 years, <u>not 20</u>,
            they should cost little or nothing to obtain for early-career
            inventors, and the protection should be handled by a government
            agency. </p>
          <p>The good news is that there's an alternative that doesn't require
            waiting for the slow (and maybe impossible) process of having patent
            law changed, and that's releasing technology as open source. This is
            a hard pill to swallow for so many entrepreneurs who lean on the
            existence of IP when making pitches to investors, and for the
            investors who expect there to be IP, etc, but time and again it's
            been shown that allowing community involvement in new ideas drives
            widespread adoption so rapidly that the originator (person or
            company) of the idea benefits financially <i>more so</i> than with
            a patent, even without having exclusivity. It's one of those
            counter-intuitive things about how to do business. </p>
          <p>But what if someone else swoops in and tries to copy what you're
            doing? Firstly, I hate to say it, but most people don't want your
            idea. No one's going to find what you're doing on some lonely
            back-alley part of the internet and then go through the
            expense/effort of producing it from under you without first seeing
            that it's a successful concept that other people want and like. That
            is, you're almost guaranteed a grace period after first releasing a
            new idea. Only once it starts selling and becoming popular do you
            have to worry about copy cats. Secondly, if you're a true startup
            company with multiple employees and venture capital funding, you can
            just keep the design data secret until you go to market. Or keep it
            secret indefinitely, but rest assured, spending money on protecting
            the intellectual property will wind up a waste of money. And don't
            forget about patent trolls. Uff, patent trolls. </p>
          <p>Open source hardware does work well, but perhaps you, as an
            entrepreneur, inventor, or investor, are not willing to go to that
            extreme. Like everything in life, this need not be absolute. Here
            are a few alternatives to "pure" open source:</p>
          <p>Option A (version priority) <br>
            The developer only makes each previous version of the product or
            technology public. I don't really like this but feel it's vastly
            better than closed source, and possibly this is paletable to many
            companys that wouldn't otherwise consider open source.</p>
          <p>Option B (functional data only): <br>
            The developer shares the schematic but not the PCB layout. I think
            this is a reasonable option, though hard to implement for mechanical
            or optical systems.</p>
          <p>Option C (stylistic variation): <br>
            The developer maintains a version of the technology which is
            stylistically enhanced but functionally equivalent to the open
            source design. This seems reasonable to me for mechanical designs,
            or for software, where a backend may be open source but a GUI is
            proprietary.</p>
          <h3> The Spirit of Open Source</h3>
          What about me? Do I worry about copy cats? My own take on all this is
          that it would be wrong for someone else to take my designs and
          reproduce them for sale exactly as-is. That's just plain theft and not
          consistent with the spirit of open source. For me, publishing design
          data has two purposes: </div>
        <br>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">1. To empower the user to truly
          understand their technology, giving them license to repair and
          maintain, or to produce the technology for their own use or
          experimentation without having to pay someone else for it. </div>
        <br>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">2. To provide a springboard for
          other developers/companies/researchers. We want to stand on the
          shoulders of giants and make sure technology only gets better over
          time. This should result in new and improved products, but which only
          get released after substantive changes have been made to the open
          source reference design.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">The philosophy I've outlined
          here would seem to suggest a specific kind of open source license
          which forbids the outright copying of a design for commercial use, but
          which encourages copying for R&amp;D or for personal use, or for
          implementation as a sub-system as part of more complicated technology.
          I haven't found an open source license that does that, which is
          surprising to me considering everyone and their mom seems to have
          written an OS license just for the heck of it. So here's my own rather
          crude open source license, which applies to all Sky's Edge
          projects/products:<br>
          <p><br>
            <a href="../opensource/index.html">The Sky's Edge License</a> </p>
          <br>
          <p>But, in releasing open source hardware, for God's sake do it right:
            If you decide to work up your own product based on an open source
            reference design, <u>give it a unique name</u> and <u>document it
              with care</u>. <br>
